# HungarianAlgorithm
[Click here to watch a demo of our implementation of the Hungarian Algorithm](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SfF4lwi-jNCSffSSAZp9cwmNnrXA2RWW/view?usp=sharing "Link to Demo")

A run through of the codes in this repository. 

1. HungarianAlgorithm.cpp - Contains the actual code, which can be run with C++14 ```g++ -std=c++14 HungarianAlgorithm.cpp```
2. HungarianAlgorithmGraphic.cpp - Contains demo code to visualise, but needs certain libraries to be installed
3. Applications - Contains 3 Problems, 2 of which are discussed in the Report. The link to the third problem is in the file (Problem3.cpp)
4. Testcases - Contains testcases, run them like ``` ./a.out < Testcases/testcase100.in ```. TestcaseX.in denotes the size of the matrix X. To prove it works in O(n^3), run the X = 1000 testcase and see it work in ~2 seconds.
